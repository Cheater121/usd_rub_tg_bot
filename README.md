# usd_rub_tg_bot
You can run this bot to Get usd to rub exchange rate.  

It will send every 3 hours message with current rate in your chat in telegram.  

For Get it uses https://exchangeratesapi.io (Exchange Rates API) - for free 250 requests per month.  

You need to make tokens.py with tg_token (telegram token of your bot).  

and exch_token (exchangeratesapi.io token).  

Or you can add two variable in usd_rub_tg_bot.py with delete import.  

Good luck.

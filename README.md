# usd_rub_tg_bot
You can run this bot to Get usd to rub exchange rate. \n 
It will send every 3 hours message with current rate in your chat in telegram. \n
For Get it uses https://exchangeratesapi.io (Exchange Rates API) - for free 250 requests per month \n
You need to make tokens.py with tg_token (telegram token of your bot) \n
and exch_token (exchangeratesapi.io token). \n
Or you can add two variable in usd_rub_tg_bot.py with delete import.\n 
Good luck.
